# Build a Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

During this week we will meet-up in Sthlm â€“ YAY! During those days we will practice our Javascript and API skills a bit more. During the days we will also work as a real team using Github - you will experience, first-hand, the issues and problems that can occur when working together with code. 

During the session your team will be challenged to build a website that lists restaurants and their reviews and information â€“ YUM ðŸ˜‹. Your page will be build based on the combination of a random selected cuisine + city + design. All data should be fetched from the Zomato API.  

For example, maybe you will get challenged to build a website to list **indian** cuisine in **London.** 

## How to complete this task
We have a very limited time-frame for this project. Therefore you need to have made this weeks practices before we meet-up.  That will make your group solve the main task quickly and can then focus on different features for the site during the meet-up. 

*The following steps should be done during the meet-up:* 

### Step 1
Fork this repo and invite all your team-mates to the repository. 

### Step 2
Togeteher as a big mob, do the foundations of the project together. Make sure that you have fetched from the API and presented all data on the page in a suitable HTML structure. You can also use one persons code from the practices as long as **everyone** understands the code. No styling is needed at this point. 

You should now have data from each restaurant on your page: 
â€“ A title
â€“ Decription
â€“ Image
â€“ Rating 

### Step 3 

Divide into pairs or groups of three and choose freely from the selection of features below. The groups will work separatley on features in their own `feature branch` and we will merge this into a bigger project before the demo. Ofc â€“ have communication within the group and feel free to merge and commit code when you feel that the time is right. Help each-other and share knowledge in the team is always incouraged. 

### Features
Suggestion of features for your site, choose the ones that interest you to implement: 

**ðŸŽ¨Implement the randomly given design.**
You don't need to implement all sections (if there's any that is not relevant to your site) but try and copy the page look and feel and design details. Feel free to make text, logo and other things your own â€“ it's a tribute, not an exact copy. 

**ðŸ’°Filter on price range** 
Add so that your users can filter restaurants based on different price ranges. 

**ðŸš€Sort on price** 
Add so that your users can sort the resturants on price, cheap to expensive using the `average_cost_for_two` parameter. 

**ðŸ’¬List reviews** 
List the 3 latest reviews for each restaurant. 

**ðŸ’¬Sort on review ** 
List the 3 latest reviews for each restaurant. 

**ðŸ–¼Show image gallery**
When clicking on the image of the retstaurant try and show an image gallery â€“ a lightbox. With the photos given from the API.

**ðŸ“±Make the page responsive**
To work on mobile, desktop or tablet. 

Feel free to challenge yourself and team to come up with more features! This is your group project â€“ you decided. 

### Feature freeze 
There's a thing called [feature freeze.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_(software_engineering)), ours will be at 2 hours before the demo. That's when it's time for you to merge your project â€“ and our teachers will have a bit of a though time. Expect merge conflicts at this point! After this point, try and only make smaller changes to your site and fix bugs. 

Work as a team!  

Good luck!
